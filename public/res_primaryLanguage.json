      "description": "Hello, I'm Tyler Main, and I'm a full-stack JavaScript developer. I'm also a Marine Corps veteran and a first-generation college graduate. I've always loved leveraging technology for creativity and solving problems. I thrive in fast-paced environments where adapting to an ever-changing digital world is a priority and I love being part of a team just as much as taking the lead. My background is a valuable asset to any team that values good taste in visual design elements and strong oral presentation, writing, and copy-editing skills. I encourage you to check out my portfolio to see what I've been up to. Let's build something great together!",
